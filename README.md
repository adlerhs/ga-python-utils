# ga-python-utils
Repo used for sharing. I'm learning python so please no judging :)

Apparently GA has a cap for 1M rows. For instance, I got 999.435 rows for May (1-31) and got 999.320 rows for May (1-10). I observed the same throughout several other months. So I've tweaked around to adjust the requested dates accordingly. All you need to do is fill in the months that you want to extract data.

exportGAEvents.py
  Get events data of desired months and outputs to a CSV.
exportGAPageViews.py
  Get pageviews data of desired months and outputs to a CSV.
  
  Feedbacks are very welcome!
