Repo used for sharing. I'm learning python so please no judging :)

Apparently GA has a cap for 1M rows. For instance, I got 999.435 rows for the month of may (1-31) and got 999.320 rows for May 1st to 10th. So I've tweaked around to adjust accordingly. All you need to do is fill in the months that you want to extract data.
  exportGAEvents.py
